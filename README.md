## 👩‍💻 About Me
Hi, I’m **Shayna**, a full stack web developer with a passion for building clean, user-friendly, and accessible web applications.  
I transitioned into tech through an intensive full stack web development bootcamp where I built both front-end and back-end projects from scratch. I love solving problems through code, learning new technologies, and creating tools that make people’s lives easier.
